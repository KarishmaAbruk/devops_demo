## Jenkins installers are available for several Linux(Ubantu) distributions.

Long Term Support release Jenkins

A LTS (Long-Term Support) release is chosen every 12 weeks from the stream of regular releases as the stable release for that time period. It can be installed from the debian-stable apt repository.

sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
  
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
  
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install jenkins

## Installation of Java

Jenkins requires Java to run, yet not all Linux distributions include Java by default. Additionally, not all Java versions are compatible with Jenkins.

There are multiple Java implementations which you can use. 

OpenJDK is the most popular one at the moment, we will use it in this guide.



## Update the Debian apt repositories, install OpenJDK 21, and check the installation with the commands:

sudo apt update


sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-21-jre

java -version

openjdk version "21.0.3" 2024-04-16

OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 21.0.3+11-Debian-2)

OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 21.0.3+11-Debian-2, mixed mode, sharing)


## Start Jenkins


### You can enable the Jenkins service to start at boot with the command:

sudo systemctl enable jenkins


### You can start the Jenkins service with the command:

sudo systemctl start jenkins



### You can check the status of the Jenkins service using the command:

sudo systemctl status jenkins


** The package installation will:

* Setup Jenkins as a daemon launched on start. Run systemctl cat jenkins for more details.

* Create a ‘jenkins’ user to run this service.

* Direct console log output to systemd-journald. Run journalctl -u jenkins.service if you are troubleshooting Jenkins.

* Populate /lib/systemd/system/jenkins.service with configuration parameters for the launch, e.g JENKINS_HOME

* Set Jenkins to listen on port 8080. Access this port with your browser to start configuration.
